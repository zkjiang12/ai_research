spent a total of ~1hr (11/15/2025)

had basic knowledge of everything before hand and sophmore year of highschool built neural net from scratch.
but still had to reason through which derivatives to use and then how to update the weights.

was pretty fun. quite simple. 

the math makes sense. I think it gets slightly complicated when we add more neurons and we add a non-linearity and we add more layers, but that should still be logicable.

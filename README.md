# ai_research

learning AI research from first principles. 

#Why I'm doing this
It's fun. It's intellectually stimulating. It increases my optionality. 

It would be a waste to live through the AI transition and not understand it intimately.

#What I want to get out of doing this
Really strong fundamentals understanding of frontier AI so I can reason upon developements and have a foundation to build upon if I ever want to conduct AI research. 

#Process
First reasoning through regression and basic neural nets. 

Then following Karpathy's implemntations of neural nets, transformers, then LLMs.
